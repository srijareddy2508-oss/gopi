      <p>The first time we met, I didn’t realize you would become this important in my life.</p>

      <p>The first time we had a conversation, I never imagined I would one day be discussing our future.</p>

      <p>The first time we shared our interests, I never thought I would one day imagine us sharing a home.</p>

      <p>The first time we hugged, I never knew I would crave your touch this much.</p>

      <p>
        I always wanted peace in my life. Not that I never had it, but with you, I finally understood 
        what real peace feels like. From the day we met, just having you by my side gave me the calm 
        I had been searching for.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was never planned, never forced, never expected. Yet everything felt so easy 
        how we grew close, how we found each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time I think of you, I smile.<br>
        Every time I talk to you, I forget everything else.<br>
        Every time I’m with you, my heart feels safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I promise you that I choose you, and I will choose you again and again, without pause and without doubt. 
        I want to stand by your side every day, to listen to you, to hold your hand, and to build a beautiful life together.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are my favorite ❤️<br>
        I love everything about you-the way you are, the way you care, the amazing person you are.
